# AGENTS.md

This file provides shared instructions to all AI coding agents working in this repository (Claude Code, Kilo Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI). Standards and skills are imported from [agent-standards](https://github.com/Lukk17/agent-standards).

## Skills

This project includes agent skills in `.agents/skills/`. Invoke relevant skills before starting implementation work. Examples:

- `/code-reviewer` before reviewing code
- `/security-review` before auditing for vulnerabilities
- `/coding-standards` before writing new code
- `/tdd-workflow` before adding features or fixing bugs

Slash commands may appear as `/name` or `/name.md` in your agent's autocomplete — use whichever your agent shows.

## Subagents

This project ships 26 specialised subagents — narrow-scope agents the main session delegates to. Claude Code reads `.claude/agents/`; OpenCode and Kilo Code both read `.opencode/agents/`. Codex CLI has no per-agent file mechanism — it sees `AGENTS.md` plus skills only.

These files are generated artifacts pulled from agent-standards. Do **not** hand-edit them — changes will be overwritten on the next pull. To modify a subagent permanently, edit its canonical source in the agent-standards repo (`subagents/<name>.md`), regenerate there, and re-import.

A few of the most-used:

- `code-reviewer` — security-aware diff review before merge
- `test-automator` — write missing tests and fix failures without weakening assertions
- `security-auditor` — threat modelling, secure-coding review, compliance gap analysis
- `backend-architect` — contract-first service and API design
- `database-expert` — schema design and query / index optimisation
- `debugger` — root-cause analysis for a single failing test or runtime error
- `devops-troubleshooter` — live incident response with postmortem

Full catalogue: see the agent-standards README's "Subagents catalog" section, or list `.claude/agents/*.md` (or `.opencode/agents/*.md`) in this project.

## Working With Agents

All supported agents read this `AGENTS.md` from the project root and auto-discover skills from `.agents/skills/`. Start your agent from the project root:

- **Claude Code** — run `claude`. Reads `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, which imports this file.
- **Kilo Code** — reads `AGENTS.md` automatically. Optional `kilo.jsonc` for extra config.
- **OpenCode** — reads `AGENTS.md` automatically. Optional `opencode.json` at project root.
- **Codex CLI** — run `codex`. Reads `AGENTS.md` automatically. Global settings in `~/.codex/config.toml`.

## Working Principles

Apply these to every task, in order. They govern *how* you work; the `coding-standards` skill governs *what the code should look like*.

### 1. Think Before Coding

State assumptions explicitly. When the prompt is ambiguous, surface the interpretations and ask — do not pick one silently and run with it. If a simpler approach exists, propose it before writing code. Stop and ask when genuinely unsure — a clarifying question costs less than a wrong implementation.

### 2. Simplicity First

Write the minimum code that solves the problem.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for scenarios that cannot happen.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

Test: would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what the task requires.

- Do not "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor code that is not broken.
- Match existing style, even if you would write it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — do not delete it.
- Remove imports, variables, and helpers that *your* changes orphan. Leave pre-existing dead code alone unless asked.

Test: every changed line should trace directly to the request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success before starting. Convert vague asks into verifiable goals:

| Instead of...       | Transform to...                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Add validation"    | "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"                 |
| "Fix the bug"       | "Write a failing test that reproduces it, then make it pass"          |
| "Refactor X"        | "Ensure tests pass before and after, behavior unchanged"              |

For multi-step work, state the plan first:

1. `<step>` → verify: `<check>`
2. `<step>` → verify: `<check>`
3. `<step>` → verify: `<check>`

Then loop until each check passes. Do not claim a task is done without running the verification.

## OpenSpec Workflow

This project uses [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) for spec-driven development. Specs and changes live under `openspec/`.

The full lifecycle (run inside your agent shell):

1. **Propose a change** — agent generates proposal, design, and `tasks.md` under `openspec/changes/`:
   ```text
   /opsx:propose add dark mode support
   ```
2. **Apply the code** — after reviewing/editing `tasks.md`, agent implements and checks off tasks:
   ```text
   /opsx:apply
   ```
3. **Verify and refine** — pass back logs or bug reports to refine:
   ```text
   /opsx:verify The toggle button is invisible on mobile. Fix it.
   ```
4. **Archive** — once tested, merge delta specs into `openspec/specs/` and archive the change folder:
   ```text
   /opsx:archive
   ```

Some agents render commands as `/opsx-propose.md` instead of `/opsx:propose` — both work; use what appears in your autocomplete.

Use multiline prompts when you need to include logs or detailed context with a command.

## What This Repo Is

`workout_log` is a Flutter mobile application (Android-first, iOS-capable) for logging gym workouts — exercises, body parts, sets, reps, and dates. It is published on the Google Play Store (`com.lukk.workoutlog`). Single-app repo, owned by Łukasz Sarna. Current version `2.0.0+9` (see `pubspec.yaml`).

## Architecture

- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart SDK `>=3.8.0 <4.0.0`), Material Design.
- **State management**: Riverpod (`flutter_riverpod` 3.x). `ProviderScope` at the root; pages are `ConsumerWidget` / `ConsumerStatefulWidget`. Static mutable shared state is forbidden — themes, the selected date, and async data flow through providers.
- **Layout under `lib/`**:
  - `data/db/` — `DBProvider` (sqflite DAO).
  - `domain/models/` — freezed immutable value types (`Exercise`, `WorkLog`, `BodyPart`) with generated `*.freezed.dart` + `*.g.dart`.
  - `presentation/providers/` — Riverpod providers (`theme_providers`, `selected_date_provider`, `data_providers`).
  - `presentation/theme/` — `WorkoutColors` `ThemeExtension`, `lightTheme` / `darkTheme`.
  - `presentation/widgets/` — shared widgets (`ResponsiveScaffold`, `ResponsiveDimensions`).
  - `view/` — page widgets (kept at `view/` for now; pending a rename pass to `presentation/pages/*_snake.dart`).
  - `util/util.dart` — screen-size + orientation + date-formatter helpers.
  - `main.dart` — bootstrap (`runApp(ProviderScope(child: MyApp()))`).
- **Persistence**: local-only — `sqflite` for workouts, `shared_preferences` for theme + background-image prefs, `path_provider` for backup file paths. No backend; no network deps.
- **Codegen**: `build_runner` 2.15 driving `freezed` 3.x + `json_serializable` 6.14. Regenerate with `dart run build_runner build`.
- **Key packages**: `flutter_riverpod`, `freezed_annotation`, `table_calendar`, `flutter_slidable`, `intl`, `uuid`, `logging`. Test: `sqflite_common_ffi` for on-host DB tests.
- **Deploy target**: Android (signed AAB to Play Store). iOS configured but not actively published.
- **Constraints**: offline-first (no network layer), single-developer project, conventions enforced via skills in `.agents/skills/` and the OpenSpec workflow for non-trivial changes.
